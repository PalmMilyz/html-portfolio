<h1>The Best Movie That Mily Love <3</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies at all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Paradise of Thorns</h3>
<p>
  This movie is showing how tragic it is for same-sex lovers who cannot legally
  marry when their partner passes away.
</p>

<h3>Blue Exorcist</h3>
<p>
  I like the cat Kuro and all kind of unique monster including the main
  charecter.
</p>

<h3>Kai Ju No.8</h3>
<p>
  Love how strong of the leading character and how OP he is.<br />
  Also I love these kind of artwork.
