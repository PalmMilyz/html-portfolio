<h1>About Me</h1>

  My name is Mily. I took this course because I want to achieve new skill in
  other than my previous work as a customer service export office worker.

  I'm an Export Customer Service Officer which experienced customer service
  representative in terms of freight forwarder including knowledge of booking
  vessels, issuing export documentation, and coordinating with customers and
  shipping lines. I also have specific experience with leather chemical products
  containing dangerous goods. I'm a positive person and certainly focus on the
  importance of skill development. With a particular interest in the Full-Stack
  Developer or QA Tester.
